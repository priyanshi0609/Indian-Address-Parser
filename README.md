# Indian-Address-Parser


A Python-based project that extracts structured components (like house number, street, locality, city, state, and pincode) from unstructured Indian addresses using regex and NLP (spaCy). It helps in cleaning, standardizing, and validating Indian address data, with optional integration of a PIN code dataset for accuracy.
